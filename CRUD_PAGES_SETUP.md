## Database Changes

### New Table: `doghealthy_vets`
Created a new vets table with:
- User-specific vet contacts
- Primary vet designation
- Full contact information

### Updated Tables
All existing tables have been updated to include:
- `user_id` foreign key for direct user access
- `vet_id` foreign key to link records to veterinarians
- Additional fields required by the UI

### Migrations
Two new migration files have been created:
1. `20251011000004_create_vets_table.sql` - Creates the vets table
2. `20251011000005_update_tables_for_vet_linking.sql` - Updates existing tables

The `run-all-migrations.sql` file has been updated to include these changes.

## Running the Migrations

### Option 1: Run All Migrations (Recommended for fresh setup)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/run-all-migrations.sql`
4. Paste and run in the SQL Editor

### Option 2: Run Individual New Migrations (If you already have existing tables)
1. Run `supabase/migrations/20251011000004_create_vets_table.sql`
2. Run `supabase/migrations/20251011000005_update_tables_for_vet_linking.sql`

â”œâ”€â”€ index.vue           # Dog detail page (updated with Vets link)
â”œâ”€â”€ edit.vue            # Edit dog page (existing)

```

## Testing the Pages

1. **Run migrations** (see above)
2. **Start your dev server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Navigate to a dog's detail page**
4. **Click on any of the 5 quick action cards**:
   - Health Records
   - Vaccinations  
   - Medications
   - Appointments
   - Vets

## Additional Notes

### Tailwind CSS
All pages use Tailwind CSS classes as per your preference - no inline styles.

### Supabase Integration
All pages use the `useSupabase()` composable for database operations.

### Pinia Store
All pages use the `useAuthStore()` for authentication state.

### Navigation
- Back buttons return to the dog detail page
- Links to manage vets from other forms
- Consistent navigation patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migrations** in Supabase
2. **Test all CRUD operations** for each section
3. **Add your first vet** before adding health records, vaccinations, etc. (optional but recommended for testing the vet linking feature)

## Known Limitations

- File attachments are not yet implemented in Health Records
- Email reminders for vaccinations and appointments are not yet implemented
- Weight tracking from the dog detail page is not yet implemented

These features can be added in future iterations if needed.
